If: \\[t = 3\\] \\[N = 15\\] where \\(t\\) is the number of treatments and \\(N\\) is the total number of samples/replicates, then:\n\nTreatment df \\(= t - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\\)\nResidual df \\(= N - t = 15 - 3 = 12\\)\nTotal df \\(= N - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\n\\(\\mathbf{2}\\)\n\\(d\\)\n\\(152.96\\)\n\\(i\\)\n\n\nResidual\n\\(\\mathbf{12}\\)\n\\(e\\)\n\\(h\\)\n\n\n\nTotal\n\\(\\mathbf{14}\\)\n\\(f\\)\n\\(i\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding 1\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the degrees of freedom tell us about the balance of the experiment?\nIf the sum of the degrees of freedom for the treatment and residual is equal to the total degrees of freedom, then the experiment is balanced. If not, then the experiment is unbalanced i.e. the number of replicates is not the same for each treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 2 Total mean sum of squares \\(MS_{tot}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo calculate total mean sum of squares \\(MS_{tot}\\), we can use the overall standard deviation \\(s = 5.11\\) to estimate the total variance, which is equivalent to the total mean square. We can calculate \\(MS_{tot}\\) by squaring the overall standard deviation \\(s^2\\): \\[MS_{tot} = s^2_{tot} = 5.11^2 = 26.1121\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\n\\(2\\)\n\\(d\\)\n\\(152.96\\)\n\\(i\\)\n\n\nResidual\n\\(12\\)\n\\(e\\)\n\\(h\\)\n\n\n\nTotal\n\\(14\\)\n\\(f\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{26.11}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you look a the total mean square value, what does it tell you about the “spread” of the data?\nThe total mean square is the variance of the data as a whole (i.e. not treatment-specific). It tells us how much the data varies from the overall mean. The larger the value, the more spread out the data is.\nA large value for \\(MS_{tot}\\) can be due to a large treatment effect or a large residual effect. The F-statistic will help us determine which one it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 3 Total \\(SS_{tot}\\) and Treatment \\(SS_{trt}\\) sum of squares\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we know that a mean sums of squares is calculated by dividing the sum of squares by the degrees of freedom i.e. \\[MS = \\frac{SS}{df}\\] then, rearranging the equation we have: \\[SS = MS \\times df\\]\nWe can calculate the total sum of squares \\(SS_{tot}\\) by multiplying the total mean square \\(MS_{tot}\\) by the total degrees of freedom \\(df_{tot}\\): \\[SS_{tot} = MS_{tot} \\times df_{tot} = 26.1121 \\times 14 = 365.5694\\]\nThe same can be done for the treatment sum of squares \\(SS_{trt}\\): \\[SS_{trt} = MS_{trt} \\times df_{trt} = 152.96 \\times 2 = 305.92\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\n\\(2\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{305.92}\\)\n\\(152.96\\)\n\\(i\\)\n\n\nResidual\n\\(12\\)\n\\(e\\)\n\\(h\\)\n\n\n\nTotal\n\\(14\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{365.60}\\)\n\\(26.11\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding 3\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the treatment and residual sum of squares?\nThe treatment sum of squares \\(SS_{trt}\\) is the variation between the treatment means and the overall mean. It tells us how much the treatment means differ from the overall mean.\nThe residual sum of squares \\(SS_{res}\\) is the variation between the individual observations and their treatment means. It tells us how much the individual observations differ from their treatment means.\nBy simply looking at the sum of squares, we can tell how much of the variation is due to the treatment and how much is due to the residual. The F-statistic will help us determine which one is more important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 4 Residual \\(SS_{res}\\) and Residual \\(MS_{res}\\) sum of squares\n\n\n\n\n\nSince total sum of squares \\(SS_{tot}\\) is the sum of the treatment sum of squares \\(SS_{trt}\\) and the residual sum of squares \\(SS_{res}\\), we can calculate the residual sum of squares \\(SS_{res}\\) by subtracting the treatment sum of squares \\(SS_{trt}\\) from the total sum of squares \\(SS_{tot}\\): \\[SS_{res} = SS_{tot} - SS_{trt} = 365.5694 - 305.92 = 59.6494\\]\nWe can then calculate the residual mean square \\(MS_{res}\\) by dividing the residual sum of squares \\(SS_{res}\\) by the residual degrees of freedom \\(df_{res}\\): \\[MS_{res} = \\frac{SS_{res}}{df_{res}} = \\frac{59.6494}{12} = 4.970783\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\n\\(2\\)\n\\(305.92\\)\n\\(152.96\\)\n\\(i\\)\n\n\nResidual\n\\(12\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{59.65}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{4.97}\\)\n\n\n\nTotal\n\\(14\\)\n\\(365.60\\)\n\\(26.11\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding 4\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we need to calculate mean sums of squares \\(MS\\) if we already have the sum of squares \\(SS\\)?\nThe mean sum of squares \\(MS\\) is a measure of the variation in the data that is independent of the degrees of freedom i.e. standardised. This makes it easier to compare the variation between different treatments and the residual variation. The resulting F-statsistic is therefore also independent of the degrees of freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 5 F-Statistic\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can calculate the F-statistic by dividing the treatment mean square \\(MS_{trt}\\) by the residual mean square \\(MS_{res}\\): \\[F = \\frac{MS_{trt}}{MS_{res}} = \\frac{152.96}{4.970783} = 30.7781\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\n\\(2\\)\n\\(305.92\\)\n\\(152.96\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{30.78}\\)\n\n\nResidual\n\\(12\\)\n\\(59.65\\)\n\\(4.97\\)\n\n\n\nTotal\n\\(14\\)\n\\(365.60\\)\n\\(26.11\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding 5\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the F-statistic tell us?\nThe F-statistic is a measure of the variation between the treatment means and the residual variation. It tells us how much the treatment means differ from the overall mean relative to how much the individual observations differ from their treatment means. If the F-statistic is large (i.e. greater than 1), then the treatment means differ from the overall mean more than the individual observations differ from their treatment means. This means that the treatment means are significantly different from each other. The F-statistic is used to test the null hypothesis that the treatment means are equal.",

    "text": "Which treatment means are different?\nTo determine which treatment means are different, we can perform a post-hoc test such as Tukey’s HSD test. This test will tell us which treatment means are significantly different from each other.\nSince we do not have access to R, we will not be able to perform the Tukey’s HSD test in this tutorial. But can the original table give us a hint?\n\nknitr::kable(maize)\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nMean\nStd.Dev\nVariance\n\n\n\n\n20 plants per unit area\n17.58\n2.70\n7.29\n\n\n30 plants per unit area\n27.18\n1.89\n3.577\n\n\n40 plants per unit area\n27.14\n2.02\n4.093\n\n\nOverall\n23.97\n5.11\n-\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the table table above we can see that the mean kg of dry matter per plot for the 30 and 40 plants per unit area are very similar. This suggests that the treatment means for 30 and 40 plants per unit area are not significantly different from each other. The treatment mean for 20 plants per unit area is probably significantly different from the other two treatments.\nBut beware! This is only a hint and not a definitive answer. We need to perform a post-hoc test to be sure. This will be covered in the labs!\nThat’s it – you have completed this tutorial.",
